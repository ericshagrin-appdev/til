title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

1. How symbols relate to strings
2. That tests run using a series of assert statements (connection with Python)
3. Methods work in crazy interesting ways and classes/methods are quite similar to Python
